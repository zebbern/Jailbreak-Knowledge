# Section 7: Defensive Implications & Recommendations
## Strategic Defense Architecture for the Post-Policy Puppetry Era (45 Minutes)

## ðŸš¨ THE NEW THREAT LANDSCAPE

### Paradigm Shift: From Isolated Incidents to Systematic Exploitation

**Critical Reality**: The discovery of Policy Puppetry and advanced combination attacks represents a fundamental shift from isolated AI safety failures to systematic, predictable exploitation of architectural vulnerabilities. Organizations must completely rethink their AI security posture.
