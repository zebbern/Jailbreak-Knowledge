# Section 5: Combination Attack Strategies - Advanced Orchestration
## Multi-Vector Attack Orchestration and Advanced Evasion (45 Minutes)

## ðŸŽ­ THE ART OF ATTACK ORCHESTRATION

### Multi-Vector Attack Theory

**Revolutionary Approach**: Advanced attackers don't use single techniques - they orchestrate multiple attack vectors simultaneously to create compound effects that overwhelm AI safety systems through **attack vector multiplication** and **defensive resource exhaustion**.
